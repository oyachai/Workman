The Kuality Layout is free to the public.
This means that there is no license, permission, or fee necessary to use or implement the layout itself (arrangement of keys), or the installation files that I released.
Use it, implement it, integrate it, create tools for it, etc. Have a go at it. You donâ€™t need my permission to do so.

However, if you do use or implement the Kuality Layout (i.e. arrangement of the keys) in some way or fashion, attribution to OJ Bucao as the creator is requested and a link back to this blog. This means that if you have an Kuality Layout implementation/installation file that you created for some platform or OS, please put somewhere in the file something like the following:

Also if you use content from my blog or articles or quote me directly, please use proper citation .

Having said this, I am also retaining the rights to the name Kuality.
As the author of the Kuality Keyboard Layout, I am retaining the right to name what is officially to be called Kuality.
This means that if you have an idea for a cool new keyboard layout, or decide to modify Kuality into something else (i.e. not using the Kuality Layout alphabetic arrangement), please name your layout differently unless you have my permission to do so.

You may however make variations of the Kuality Layout that does not modify or change the alphabetic arrangement of the original and you may call it as some variation of the Kuality Layout (e.g. Kuality Layout wide mod, etc.)

The Kuality Layout is provided with no warranty or guarantee of any kind.
